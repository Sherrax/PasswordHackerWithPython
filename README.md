## Requirements

- Python 3.x

- JSON library (comes with Python standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
2. 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-hacker.git
   cd password-hacker
Create a logins.txt file in the same directory, and add the list of logins you want to test (one login per line).
Usage
Run the script from the command line, providing the server address and port as arguments:

bash
python password_hacker.py <host> <port>
Example
bash

python password_hacker.py 127.0.0.1 8080
How It Works
The program reads a list of potential logins from a file called logins.txt.
It attempts to find a valid login by sending a predefined password to the server.
Once a valid login is found, it proceeds to find the corresponding password by sending various character combinations and measuring the response time from the server.
If the server indicates a successful connection, the program prints the found login and password in JSON format.
